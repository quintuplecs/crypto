# crypto
This is a curated list of solutions to different cryptography challenges. Most of the challenges are formatted the same way as is all of our other solution repos, with the exception of cryptopals. Because of the way cryptopals is formatted, I've decided to "pin" key challenges that will be useful later on.

# cryptopals
| Challenge                                            | Set | Number |

| [Break repeating-key XOR](cryptopals/set_1/chal6.py) | 1   | 6      |
